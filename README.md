# Architecture Pattern Analyzer for AI Models

## Project Overview

This application allows users to analyze and compare different software architecture patterns for deploying and managing generative AI models at scale. It evaluates various metrics across different architectural approaches and provides recommendations for optimal deployment strategies.

## Features

- **Pattern Analysis**: Evaluate application performance across six different architecture patterns
- **Comprehensive Metrics**: Compare patterns using throughput, latency, availability, resource utilization, and more
- **Visual Comparisons**: Interactive charts and graphs for easy metric comparison
- **Before/After Analysis**: Compare performance before and after implementing recommended patterns
- **Detailed Reports**: Generate and download detailed analysis reports

## Architecture Patterns Evaluated

1. **Monolithic Architecture**
2. **Microservices Architecture**
3. **Serverless Architecture**
4. **Event-Driven Architecture**
5. **Peer-to-Peer Architecture**
6. **Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)**

## Metrics Measured

- **Throughput**: Number of requests processed per second
- **Latency**: Response time in milliseconds
- **Availability**: System uptime percentage
- **Resource Utilization**: CPU and memory usage
- **Fault Tolerance**: Ability to handle failures
- **Elasticity**: Ability to scale with demand
- **Cost Efficiency**: Resource utilization vs. performance
- **Data Consistency**: Consistency across distributed systems

## How It Works

1. Input your application URL for analysis
2. The system evaluates how each architecture pattern would perform with your application
3. Detailed metrics are calculated for each pattern
4. The system determines the optimal architecture pattern for your specific needs
5. Results are presented with comprehensive visualizations and comparisons

## Technical Implementation

This application is built using:

- **React**: Frontend UI framework
- **TypeScript**: For type-safe code
- **Recharts**: For data visualization
- **Tailwind CSS**: For styling
- **Shadcn UI**: Component library
- **React Router**: For navigation

In a production environment, this application would integrate with:
- Load testing tools (JMeter, Locust)
- Monitoring systems (Prometheus, Grafana)
- Cloud provider APIs (AWS, Azure, GCP)

## Getting Started

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the development server
npm run dev
```

## Future Enhancements

- Integration with real load testing frameworks
- Machine learning-based pattern recommendations
- Custom metric weightings for specific use cases
- Hybrid pattern recommendations
- Integration with cloud provider cost calculators
