# Architecture Pattern Analyzer

## Project Overview

The Architecture Pattern Analyzer is a sophisticated web application designed to help software architects, developers, and system designers evaluate and compare different software architecture patterns for their applications. The tool analyzes application characteristics and recommends the most suitable architecture pattern based on key performance metrics.

## Features

### 1. Comprehensive Architecture Analysis
- Evaluate applications against six different architecture patterns:
  - Monolithic Architecture
  - Microservices Architecture
  - Serverless Architecture
  - Event-Driven Architecture
  - Peer-to-Peer Architecture
  - Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)

### 2. Multi-Dimensional Metric Evaluation
- Compare architecture patterns across eight critical metrics:
  - **Throughput**: Number of requests processed per second
  - **Latency**: Response time in milliseconds
  - **Availability**: System uptime percentage
  - **Resource Utilization**: CPU, memory, and network usage
  - **Fault Tolerance**: Ability to handle failures
  - **Elasticity**: Ability to scale with demand
  - **Cost Efficiency**: Resource utilization vs. performance
  - **Data Consistency**: Consistency across distributed systems

### 3. Advanced Visualizations
- **Radar Charts**: Multi-dimensional metric comparison across patterns
- **Bar Charts**: Direct comparison of individual metrics
- **Distribution Charts**: Understand latency distribution
- **Resource Utilization Charts**: View CPU, memory, and network usage
- **Throughput vs. Latency**: Analyze the relationship between these critical metrics

### 4. Before/After Implementation Analysis
- Compare current vs. potential performance metrics after implementing the recommended pattern
- View percentage improvements across all metrics

### 5. Customizable Analysis Parameters
- Set load level for testing (minimal to intensive)
- Select specific architecture patterns to include in the analysis
- Customize test parameters for accurate results

### 6. Results Management
- Save, view, and compare multiple analysis reports
- Download detailed reports for offline review
- Track analysis history with timestamps and URLs

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React.js with TypeScript for type safety
- **State Management**: React Context API and React Query
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui component library
- **Data Visualization**: Recharts library for responsive, interactive charts
- **AI Integration**: GROQ API for intelligent architecture analysis
- **Routing**: React Router for seamless navigation
- **Edge Functions**: Serverless functions for backend logic
- **Database**: Supabase for data storage and retrieval

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18.0 or higher
- npm or yarn package manager
- GROQ API key for AI-powered analysis

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/architecture-pattern-analyzer.git
   cd architecture-pattern-analyzer
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```

3. Set up environment variables:
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following variables:
   ```
   GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key_here
   ```

4. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # or
   yarn dev
   ```

5. Access the application at http://localhost:5173

### Setting up GROQ API

To enable AI-powered architecture analysis:

1. Create an account at [console.groq.com](https://console.groq.com)
2. Generate an API key from your account dashboard
3. Add the API key to your environment variables

## Usage Guide

### Running an Architecture Analysis

1. Navigate to the "Test" page
2. Enter the URL of the application you want to analyze
3. Adjust the load level based on your expected traffic
4. Select the architecture patterns you want to include in the analysis
5. Click "Run Test" to initiate the analysis
6. View the results on the "Results" page

### Interpreting the Results

1. **Best Architecture Pattern**:
   - The recommended pattern appears at the top of the results page
   - View detailed benefits and limitations of this pattern

2. **Pattern Comparison**:
   - Use the "Pattern Comparison" tab to compare metrics across all patterns
   - Highest values for each metric are highlighted

3. **Metrics Detail**:
   - The "Metrics Detail" tab provides a comprehensive breakdown of each pattern's performance
   - Visual indicators show relative performance on a scale of 1-10

4. **Performance Charts**:
   - The "Performance Charts" tab offers visual representations of all metrics
   - Use these charts to identify patterns that excel in specific areas

## Deployment

### Production Deployment

To deploy the application to production:

1. Build the application:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   # or
   yarn build
   ```

2. Deploy the built assets to your hosting provider
   - Recommended: Vercel, Netlify, or any static site hosting

3. Set up environment variables in your hosting provider's dashboard

### Serverless Function Deployment

For the edge functions:

1. Deploy to Supabase:
   ```bash
   npx supabase functions deploy analyze-architecture
   ```

2. Set the GROQ API key in Supabase secrets:
   ```bash
   npx supabase secrets set GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key
   ```
